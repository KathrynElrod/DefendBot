# DefendBot

**Note: This program ONLY works on macOS.**

This program requires `requests` and `faker`. To install, run:
```
python3 -m pip install requests faker
```

You must also enable automation in Safari. Open preferences (âŒ˜ ,), navigate to Advanced, and check "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Then open the Develop menu and check "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events".

To run the program:
```
git clone https://github.com/KathrynElrod/DefendBot.git
cd DefendBot
python3 main.py
```
Do not use other applications while the progam is running. It's not dangerous, it just won't work and it'll try to type into whatever program you use. Also, I strongly recommend using a VPN so whatever transphobic fuck runs the website doesn't get your home IP. To stop the program, use ctrl+c (^ c) in the terminal.
